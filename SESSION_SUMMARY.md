# VeloReady RLS & Webhook Setup - Session Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours  
**Status**: 95% Complete (blocked by Strava API issue)

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Supabase RLS Security Setup

**Problem**: 5 security warnings in Supabase - tables exposed without Row Level Security

**Solution**: Implemented complete RLS system

#### Files Modified:
- ✅ `/netlify/functions/oauth-strava-token-exchange.ts` - Creates Supabase users during OAuth
- ✅ `/netlify/lib/db.ts` - Added `user_id` to activity inserts
- ✅ `/netlify/functions/webhooks-strava.ts` - Added `user_id` to audit_log inserts
- ✅ `/netlify/functions/me-strava-disconnect.ts` - Added `user_id` to audit_log inserts

#### Database Changes:
- ✅ Added `user_id` columns to: `athlete`, `activity`, `sync_state`, `audit_log`
- ✅ Added `athlete_id` column to `audit_log`
- ✅ Created indexes on `user_id` columns
- ✅ Enabled RLS on all 5 tables
- ✅ Created RLS policies for data isolation
- ✅ Modified audit_log policy to allow system inserts (`auth.uid() IS NULL`)

#### Backend Updates:
- ✅ Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` package
- ✅ OAuth flow now creates Supabase auth users automatically
- ✅ All database inserts include `user_id` for RLS compliance

#### Environment Variables Added:
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for user creation

### 2. Webhook System Debugging

**Problem**: Activities not syncing from Strava after RLS was enabled

**Root Causes Found**:
1. ✅ `upsertActivitySummary` wasn't including `user_id` (RLS blocked inserts)
2. ✅ `audit_log` inserts missing `user_id` (RLS blocked inserts)
3. ✅ `audit_log` table missing `athlete_id` column
4. ✅ RLS policy too restrictive (blocked system operations)
5. ⚠️ Webhook registered to old domain (`rideready.icu`)

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Added `user_id` to all activity inserts
- ✅ Added `user_id` and `athlete_id` to all audit_log inserts
- ✅ Created `athlete_id` column in audit_log table
- ✅ Modified RLS policy to allow system inserts
- ✅ Set up redirect from old domain to new domain
- ⚠️ **BLOCKED**: Cannot update Strava webhook due to API bug

---

### 3. Testing & Verification

**Tested & Working**:
- ✅ OAuth flow creates Supabase users
- ✅ `user_id` populated in athlete table
- ✅ Webhook endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ Audit log inserts work with `user_id`
- ✅ RLS policies allow system operations
- ✅ Manual webhook test logs correctly

**Verified**:
```sql
-- Test webhook logged successfully
SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE id = 7;
-- Result: activity:create:88888888 with user_id populated ✅
```

## ⚠️ Outstanding Issue

### Strava Webhook Stuck

**Problem**: 
- Old webhook registered to `https://rideready.icu/webhooks/strava`
- Old domain has SSL issues (not accessible)
- Webhook shows in LIST but returns "not found" on GET/DELETE
- Cannot create new webhook (says "already exists")

**Strava API Inconsistency**:
```bash
# LIST shows it exists
curl -G https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions ... 
# Returns: [{"id":308650, "callback_url":"https://rideready.icu/..."}]

# GET by ID says not found
curl -G https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions/308650 ...
# Returns: {"message":"Record Not Found"}

# DELETE says not found
curl -X DELETE https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions/308650 ...
# Returns: {"message":"Resource Not Found"}

# CREATE says already exists
curl -X POST https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions ...
# Returns: {"errors":[{"code":"already exists"}]}
```

**Resolution Required**:
- Email Strava support at api@strava.com
- Request deletion of webhook ID 308650
- Wait 24-48 hours for response
- Once deleted, create new webhook with veloready.app URL

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (You)
1. **Email Strava Support** (see template below)
2. **Wait for response** (24-48 hours)

### After Strava Responds
1. **Create new webhook**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions \
     -F client_id=33643 \
     -F client_secret=34cb7a447e4f9e756fe8f880cef09bd53ea88cdc \
     -F callback_url=https://veloready.app/.netlify/functions/webhooks-strava \
     -F verify_token=VELOREADY_2025_NEW
   ```

2. **Verify webhook**:
   ```bash
   curl -G https://www.strava.com/api/v3/push_subscriptions \
     -d client_id=33643 \
     -d client_secret=34cb7a447e4f9e756fe8f880cef09bd53ea88cdc
   ```

3. **Test with real activity**:
   - Create 20-second test ride on Strava
   - Check webhook logs in Netlify
   - Check audit_log in Supabase
   - Wait 5 minutes for drainer
   - Verify activity appears in database

## 📧 Email Template for Strava

To: api@strava.com
Subject: Webhook subscription stuck - cannot delete or update (ID: 308650)

Hi Strava API Team,

I have a webhook subscription in an inconsistent state that I cannot manage:

Application Details:
- Client ID: 33643
- Webhook ID: 308650
- Current callback: https://rideready.icu/webhooks/strava
- Desired callback: https://veloready.app/.netlify/functions/webhooks-strava

Issue:
- LIST endpoint shows webhook exists
- GET by ID returns "Record Not Found"
- DELETE returns "Resource Not Found"
- CREATE new webhook returns "already exists"

The old callback URL (rideready.icu) is no longer accessible due to SSL issues, so webhooks are failing. I need to update to the new domain (veloready.app).

Could you please delete webhook ID 308650 so I can create a new subscription?

Thank you!
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist (After Webhook Fixed)

```
Pre-Test:
[ ] Webhook registered to veloready.app
[ ] Webhook visible in Strava API list
[ ] All backend code deployed

Test Flow:
[ ] Create 20-second test ride on Strava
[ ] Check Netlify logs - webhook invocation within seconds
[ ] Check audit_log - webhook entry logged
[ ] Wait 5 minutes - drainer runs
[ ] Check activity table - activity stored with user_id
[ ] Check iOS app - activity appears

Verify RLS:
[ ] No security warnings in Supabase dashboard
[ ] All tables have RLS enabled
[ ] All policies created
[ ] user_id populated in all new records
```

## 📊 System Architecture (After Fixes)

```
User creates Strava activity
    ↓
Strava sends webhook → https://rideready.icu/webhooks/strava (old URL)
    ↓ (redirect)
https://veloready.app/.netlify/functions/webhooks-strava
    ↓
Webhook handler:
  1. Fetches user_id from athlete table
  2. Logs to audit_log (with user_id + athlete_id)
  3. Enqueues job to Redis (q:live)
    ↓
Scheduled drainer (every 5 min):
  1. Pops job from Redis
  2. Fetches activity from Strava API
  3. Calls upsertActivitySummary (with user_id)
  4. Stores in PostgreSQL
    ↓
RLS policies enforce:
  - Users can only see their own data
  - System operations allowed (auth.uid() IS NULL)
  - Data isolation maintained
    ↓
iOS app queries Supabase:
  - RLS automatically filters to user's data
  - No cross-user data leakage
```
