# üîê Dashboard Authentication Issue

**Problem:** Edge Function authentication not working with environment variables.

## ‚úÖ **Working Solution: Use Netlify's Built-in Password Protection**

### **Option 1: Site-Wide Password (Simplest)**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/veloready/settings/access
2. Under "Visitor access" ‚Üí Enable "Password protection"
3. Set password
4. Save

**Problem:** This protects the ENTIRE site, including API endpoints ‚ùå

---

### **Option 2: Use Netlify Identity (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/veloready/settings/identity
2. Click "Enable Identity"
3. Under "Registration" ‚Üí Set to "Invite only"
4. Under "External providers" ‚Üí Disable all
5. Go to Identity tab ‚Üí Invite yourself
6. Set password

Then update `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/ops/*"
  to = "/dashboard/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  conditions = {Role = ["admin"]}

[[redirects]]
  from = "/dashboard/*"
  to = "/dashboard/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
  conditions = {Role = ["admin"]}
```

### **Option 3: Hardcode Password in Edge Function (Quick Fix)**

Update `netlify/edge-functions/dashboard-auth.ts`:

```typescript
const validPassword = 'VeloReady2025!SecureDashboard#Ops'; // Hardcoded
```

**Pros:** Works immediately
**Cons:** Password in code (less secure)

---

## üîß **Current Issue**

Environment variables set via `netlify env:set` may not be available to Edge Functions immediately.

**Try:**
1. Set env var in Netlify UI instead of CLI
2. Redeploy site after setting
3. Check Edge Function logs

---

## üìù **Recommendation**

Use **Option 3** (hardcoded) for now to get it working, then migrate to **Option 2** (Netlify Identity) for production.
