# VeloReady Scaling Architecture & Cost Analysis

**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **1. User Authentication Flow**
```
User → iOS App → Netlify Function (oauth-strava-start)
                ↓
        Strava OAuth Page
                ↓
        User Authorizes
                ↓
        Callback → Netlify Function (oauth-strava-token-exchange)
                ↓
        Store tokens in Supabase PostgreSQL
                ↓
        User authenticated ✅
```

**What happens:**
- User taps "Connect Strava" in your iOS app
- Netlify function redirects to Strava OAuth
- Strava redirects back with authorization code
- Netlify function exchanges code for access token + refresh token
- Tokens stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- User is now connected

---

### **2. Webhook Processing (Real-Time Activity Sync)**
```
Strava Webhook → Netlify Function (webhooks-strava)
                        ↓
                Enqueue job to Upstash Redis
                        ↓
                Background Function processes job
                        ↓
                Fetch activity from Strava API
                        ↓
                Store in Supabase
                        ↓
                Activity synced ✅
```

**What happens:**
- User uploads ride to Strava
- Strava sends webhook to your Netlify function (<2s response required)
- Function quickly enqueues job to Upstash Redis queue
- Background function picks up job and processes it
- Activity data fetched from Strava API
- Stored in Supabase for your app to display

**Why this scales:**
- Webhook responds instantly (no timeout)
- Heavy processing happens asynchronously
- Queue handles traffic spikes

---

### **3. Data Flow for iOS App**
```
iOS App → Netlify Function (ai-brief)
                ↓
        Check Netlify Blobs cache
                ↓
        If cached: return immediately
        If not: Generate with OpenAI
                ↓
        Cache result in Netlify Blobs
                ↓
        Return to iOS app
```

**What happens:**
- User opens app, requests daily brief
- Function checks cache (Netlify Blobs)
- If cached (same day): instant response
- If not: generate with OpenAI, cache for 24h
- Subsequent requests hit cache (fast + cheap)

---

## 📊 Scaling to 1,000 Users

### **Daily Activity Assumptions:**
- 1,000 users
- 50% active daily (500 users)
- Average 1 activity per active user per day = **500 activities/day**
- Each user opens app 2x/day = **2,000 app opens/day**

## 📊 Strava API Compliance Impact (On-Demand Streams)

### **Decision: On-Demand vs Stored Streams**

As of October 11, 2025, we implemented **on-demand stream fetching** to comply with Strava's 7-day cache rule. This section analyzes the cost and API usage impact.

---

### **Storage Cost Impact**

| Approach | Per Activity | 1K Users/Year | 10K Users/Year | Monthly Cost (1K) | Monthly Cost (10K) |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Stored Streams** | 5KB | 912MB | 9.1GB | $25 | $99 |
| **On-Demand** | 1KB | 182MB | 1.8GB | $0 | $25 |
| **Savings** | 80% | 80% | 80% | $25 | $74 |

**Key Insight:** On-demand approach keeps you on free tier up to 1,000 users, saving $25/month.

---

### **Strava API Usage Impact**

#### **API Calls per Activity:**

| Approach | Sync | Detail View | Total (per activity) |
|----------|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Stored Streams** | 2 calls | 0 calls | 2 calls |
| **On-Demand** | 1 call | 1 call (cached 1hr) | 1-2 calls |

#### **Monthly API Calls (1,000 users, 500 activities/day):**

| Approach | Sync Calls | View Calls | Total | vs Limit (1K/day) |
|----------|------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Stored Streams** | 15,000 | 0 | 30,000 | 100% over |
| **On-Demand** | 15,000 | 3,000 | 18,000 | 60% usage ✅ |

**Result:** 40% reduction in API calls + better compliance

---

### **Rate Limit Compliance by User Count**

| Users | Daily Activities | API Calls/Day | Strava Limit | Status | Action Needed |
|-------|------------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 100 | 50 | 60 | 1,000 | ✅ 6% | None |
| 1,000 | 500 | 600 | 1,000 | ✅ 60% | None |
| 5,000 | 2,500 | 3,000 | 1,000 | ⚠️ 300% | Batch processing |
| 10,000 | 5,000 | 6,000 | 1,000 | ❌ 600% | Rate increase + batching |

---

### **Scaling Strategy by User Count**

#### **1,000 Users (Current):**
```
✅ No changes needed
- Storage: Free tier ($0/month)
- API: 600 calls/day (60% of limit)
- UX: 200-500ms delay on first detail view
- Savings: $25/month vs stored streams
```

#### **5,000 Users:**
```
⚠️ Implement batch processing
- Storage: Pro tier ($25/month)
- API: 3,000 calls/day (need batching)
- Solution: Spread syncs over 6-hour windows
- Savings: $50/month vs stored streams
```

#### **10,000 Users:**
```
⚠️ Multiple optimizations needed
1. Increase cache to 24 hours (96% API reduction)
2. Batch processing (spread load)
3. Request rate limit increase (5K-10K/day)
- Storage: Pro tier ($25/month)
- API: ~2,000 calls/day (with optimizations)
- Savings: $74/month vs stored streams
```

#### **100,000 Users:**
```

| **Activity List** | Instant | Instant | ✅ No change |
| **Activity Detail** | Instant | 200-500ms first load | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| **Charts** | Instant | 200-500ms first load | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| **Subsequent Views** | Instant | Instant (cached 1hr) | ✅ No change |

**Conclusion:** Minimal UX impact, users expect loading states for detail views.

---

### **Optimization Strategies**

#### **1. Increase Cache Duration (Easy)**
```typescript
// Current: 1-hour cache
headers: { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=3600" }

// Proposed: 24-hour cache (still <7 days, Strava compliant)
headers: { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=86400" }

Impact:
- 96% reduction in stream API calls
- Better UX (more cache hits)
- Still fully compliant
```

#### **2. Batch Processing (Medium)**
```typescript
// Instead of: Process all webhooks immediately
// Do: Batch process every 6 hours

Impact:
- Spreads API load evenly
- Stays within 15-minute rate limit
- Scales to 10K+ users
```

#### **3. Predictive Pre-fetching (Advanced)**
```typescript
// When user views activity list:
// Pre-fetch streams for top 3 most recent activities

Impact:
- Instant detail view for 60% of views
- Minimal API overhead
- Better perceived performance
```
