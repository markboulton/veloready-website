# 🚨 CRITICAL: Disable Site-Wide Password Protection

**Problem:** Netlify's site-wide password protection is STILL ENABLED and blocking our Edge Function.

---

## 🔍 **Evidence**

Response header shows:
```
www-authenticate: Basic realm="veloready.app"
```

This is Netlify's site-wide auth (realm="veloready.app"), NOT our Edge Function (realm="VeloReady Dashboard").

---

## ✅ **FIX NOW**

**I've opened the page for you:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/veloready/settings/access

### **Steps:**

1. **Look for "Visitor access" section**

2. **Find "Password protection"**
   - If it shows "Enabled" or has a password set
   - Click "Edit" or the toggle

3. **DISABLE IT**
   - Remove/disable the site-wide password
   - Click "Save"

4. **Why this is critical:**
   - Site-wide protection blocks EVERYTHING (APIs, OAuth, webhooks)
   - Our Edge Function can't run when site-wide auth is active
   - Your app will break if site-wide protection is on

---

## 🧪 **After You Disable It**

Run this test:
```bash
curl -I https://veloready.app/ops/
```

**Should see:**
```
www-authenticate: Basic realm="VeloReady Dashboard"
```

**NOT:**
```
www-authenticate: Basic realm="veloready.app"
```

---

## ✅ **Then Test Login**

After disabling site-wide protection:

**URL:** https://veloready.app/ops/

**Username:** `admin`

**Password:** `mabo4283`

---

## 📊 **What Will Work**

Once site-wide protection is disabled:

- ✅ `/ops/*` → Requires password (Edge Function)
- ✅ `/dashboard/*` → Requires password (Edge Function)
- ✅ `/api/*` → Public (no password)
- ✅ `/oauth/*` → Public (no password)
- ✅ `/webhooks/*` → Public (no password)
- ✅ App continues working

## 🚨 **ACTION REQUIRED**

**GO TO:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/veloready/settings/access

**DISABLE:** Site-wide password protection

**THEN:** Try logging into dashboard again
