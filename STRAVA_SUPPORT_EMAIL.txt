Subject: Webhook subscription stuck - cannot delete or update (ID: 308650)

Hi Strava API Team,

I have a webhook subscription in an inconsistent state that I cannot manage:

Application Details:
- Client ID: 33643
- Webhook ID: 308650
- Current callback: https://rideready.icu/webhooks/strava
- Desired callback: https://veloready.app/webhooks/strava

Issue:
- LIST endpoint shows webhook exists
- GET by ID returns "Record Not Found"
- DELETE returns "Resource Not Found"
- CREATE new webhook returns "already exists"

The old callback URL (rideready.icu) is no longer accessible due to SSL issues, so webhooks are failing. I need to update to the new domain (veloready.app).

Could you please delete webhook ID 308650 so I can create a new subscription?

Thank you!
